This License Agreement and Associated Terms of Service, (hereinafter referred to as "License Agreement") represents a binding contract between the individual or organization represented by the individual ("Client") and Agilatech LLC ("Agilatech"), with an address of 4200 Trail Creek Road, Bozeman, Montana, 59715, USA, concerning the Agilatech Software Product(s) ("Software") as of the installation date (the "Effective Date").

BY ACCESSING, INSTALLING, COPYING OR OTHERWISE USING ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE, CLIENT AGREES TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.  ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE SOFTWARE IS OWNED BY AGILATECH OR ITS SUPPLIERS. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED, NOT SOLD. AGILATECH PERMITS CLIENT TO USE OR OTHERWISE BENEFIT FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF THE SOFTWARE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. THE SOFTWARE MAY INCLUDE PRODUCT AUTHORIZATION OR REGISTRATION TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED USE AND COPYING.

1.  Acceptance. CLIENT'S INSTALLATION OF THE AGILATECH SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THE LICENSE TERMS AS DESCRIBED BELOW AND AGREES TO BE SUBJECT TO THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT AND ASSOCIATED TERMS OF SERVICE.

2.  Ownership. Client agrees that the Software, documentation, and processes are the sole property of Agilatech.  Client agrees to use best practices to keep the Software confidential and prevent misuse, unauthorized use, or any use intended to or which may lead to a process or effort to reverse engineer or otherwise gain access to proprietary information or algorithms used by Agilatech in the Software.

3.  License.  Agilatech hereby grants to Client a limited, non-sublicensable, nonexclusive, non-transferable right to use the Software in the manner and for the purposes set forth in this License Agreement and for the time period specified in the Invoice. The Documentation shall include, but is not limited to, any printed or electronic materials or data provided by or obtained from Agilatech with regard to this Software.

3.1  Client may use the Software as limited by the Allowed Number of licenses subscribed or contracted. "Allowed Number" means that number subscribed or contracted for by Client. The Software may be installed concurrently on one or more systems up to the Allowed Number of subscribed licenses, unless otherwise agreed to in writing with Agilatech. Use of software or any supporting services that bypass any Software license restrictions and/or reduce the number of installations accessing or utilizing the Software (e.g., "multiplexing," "pooling," or third party add on software or hardware) expressly does not reduce the number of licenses required (i.e., the required number of licenses would equal the number of distinct inputs to the multiplexing or pooling software or hardware "front end"). Client may install multiple instances of the Software, provided that the total number of instances installed at any given time does not exceed the Allowed Number of licenses. The Software must be licensed as an enterprise license terms pursuant to a separate enterprise level agreement to permit unlimited number of installations.

3.2  Client may make copies of the Software for backup, disaster recovery, or installation or re-installation only. All such copies shall, upon restoration or installation, conform to the Allowed Number of licenses purchased.

3.3  An evaluation license key may be provided to the Client for review of the software.  After an evaluation period and upon payment a License Key for each installation of the Software is issued to Client. That License Key is required to install or continue use of the Software by Client.

3.4  A cushion or overage conformance time is set on the Allowed Number of licenses that accommodates for the lag time between the installation, re-installation, or reimaging of computers or transfer of license between installations.  Such uninstallation and re-installation of the Software on the same or another computer may create a temporary overage on Allowed Number of licenses. If Client exceeds the Allowed Number of licenses during transfer, there is a grace period of seven (7) days to uninstall Software to return or discontinue use of the software to return to the Allowed Number of licenses.  However, during this time the number of concurrent operating installations shall not exceed the Allowed Number of licenses.

3.5  As licenses are moved from computer to computer, installation notice may be sent to Agilatech for record keeping purposes only. Some action by Agilatech may be needed for installation on additional computers.  However, Agilatech reserves the right to bill for additional installations if such installations exceed the Allowed Number of licenses.

3.6  A monthly report may be provided to Client summarizing the number of installations that have been recorded over that period.

3.7  If, after discussion with Client, Agilatech determines additional installations have been added in excess of
the Allowed Number of licenses, a statement will be submitted to Client along with an invoice for any installati
ons above the total Allowed Number. As there is an overage allowance provided, Agilatech will use the number of a
uthorized installations above the Allowed Number, plus the overage allowance, for the preceding 30 days.

3.8  All new seat purchases will be at Agilatech's then current pricing.

3.9  At the expiration of the subscription period, excepting for a perpetual license term and unless such subscription period is extended or renewed, Client agrees to promptly uninstall all installations of the Software, permanently delete all copies of installation packages of the Software in Client's possession, not restore any installations from backup or archives, and, if requested by Agilatech, provide Agilatech with written confirmation of such actions.

4.  Audit. Agilatech reserves the right to periodically conduct audits upon a thirty (30) day advance written notice to Client to verify compliance with the terms of this License Agreement.

For as long as Software is installed and used under a valid License Agreement, Agilatech warrants that the Software will substantially conform to the then-current Agilatech documentation.  In the event of conflict between the afore-mentioned documents, the then-current Agilatech user manuals shall control.  If the Software does not perform as warranted above, Agilatech will use reasonable efforts, consistent with industry standards, to cure the defect in accordance with Agilatech's then current support call process.  Should Agilatech be unable to cure the defect or provide a replacement product, Client shall be entitled to a refund of the Subscription Fees paid to Agilatech for the Software for the time period commencing when said product was determined to be defective.  Agilatech warrants that it holds title to the Software. Agilatech further warrants that:  (i) it has full power and authority to grant to the Client the rights set forth in this License Agreement; (ii) the use by the Client of the Software, or any portion thereof, will not constitute an infringement or other violation of any ownership, claim, copyright, trade secret, trademark, patent, invention, proprietary information, nondisclosure, or other rights of any third party; and (iii) all services and any maintenance or support services provided under this License Agreement will be performed in a timely, workmanlike and professional manner by Agilatech or Agilatech affiliates.

Agilatech will not be obligated under this section if the infringement results from: (i) Client's use of a non-current version of the Software and the claim would have been avoided had Client used the current version of the Software; (ii) Client's combining the Software with devices or products not provided by Agilatech, (iii) use of the Software in applications, business environments or processes for which the Software was not designed or contemplated, and where use of the Software outside such application, environment or business process would not have given rise to the claim, (iv) corrections, modifications, alterations or enhancements that Client made to the  Software without Agilatech's prior written authorization; (v) use of the Software by any person or entity other than Client or Client's employees, consultant(s) or outsourcer(s) allowed pursuant the terms of this License Agreement; or (vi) Client's willful infringement.  In the event the Software is finally determined to be infringing and its use by Client is enjoined, Agilatech shall, at its election (i) procure for Client the right to continue using the infringing Software; (ii) modify or replace the infringing Software so that it becomes non-infringing; or (iii) terminate Client's license for the Software and refund to Client the Subscription Fees paid to Agilatech by Client for the infringing Software for the time period commencing when said product was determined to be infringing .

Agilatech shall not be liable to the degree or extent of damages, loss, or expense determined to be the fault of the Client.
